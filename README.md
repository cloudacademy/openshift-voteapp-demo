# OpenShift VoteApp Deployment Instructions

The following instructions are used to demonstrate how to provision an OpenShift 4 cluster on AWS, and then to deploy a cloud native application into it, complete with automated container builds and deployments for the win!

:metal:

### Updates
* **24/08/2022**: Updated instructions to work with the latest version of OpenShift (v4.11)

The cloud native application is architected using microservices and is presented to the user as a web application. The application frontend provides the end-user with the ability to vote on one of 3 programming languages: Go, Java, and/or NodeJS. Voting results in AJAX calls being made from the browser to an API which in turn then saves the results into a MongoDB database.

![VoteApp](/docs/voteapp.png)

Along the way, you'll get to see how to work with the following OpenShift cluster resources:
* Pods
* ReplicaSets
* Deployments
* DeploymentConfigs
* Services
* StatefulSets
* PersistentVolumes
* PersistentVolumeClaims
* BuildConfigs
* Builds
* ImageStreams

We'll also show you how to work with OpenShift's [S2I](https://github.com/openshift/source-to-image) (Source-to-Image) build technology.

![OpenShiftDeployment](/docs/OpenShiftDeployment.png)

# STEP1:

Review and familiarize yourself with the OpenShift documentation found here

https://www.openshift.com/

Log into the [cloud.redhat.com](https://cloud.redhat.com/openshift/install) portal - ensure that you have access to retrieve your OpenShift 4 cluster pull secret

Note: Read and review the terms and conditions associated with spinning up an OpenShift Container Platform 4 cluster

# STEP2:

Download the ```openshift-install``` installer and setup

https://mirror.openshift.com/pub/openshift-v4/clients/ocp/latest/

```
curl -O https://mirror.openshift.com/pub/openshift-v4/clients/ocp/4.11.0/openshift-install-mac-4.11.0.tar.gz
tar -xvf openshift-install-mac-4.11.0.tar.gz
cp openshift-install /usr/local/bin/
which openshift-install
```

```
openshift-install
openshift-install version
```

Note: This script downloads version **4.11.0** of the openshift installer client - a newer version may now exist.

# STEP3:

Generate and scaffold a new ```install-config.yaml``` file

```
openshift-install create install-config
```

# STEP4:

Consider customising the generated ```install-config.yaml``` file by overwriting it with the following demo focused cluster config

Note: the following cluster config is designed for demo purposes, motivated primarily by reducing running costs
1. SINGLE AZ zone
2. 3 x m4.xlarge cluster master nodes
3. 1 x m4.xlarge compute node

Generate the SSH public key from an existing private key in your possession

```
ssh-keygen -y -f ~/.ssh/OpenShiftUSEast1.pem
```

Copy the entire key string into the ```sshKey``` field within the ```install-config.yaml``` file

Retrieve the pullSecret from the RedHat OpenShift cluster web portal:
 - https://cloud.redhat.com/openshift/install
 - copy this into the ```pullSecret``` field within the ```install-config.yaml``` file

```
cat > install-config.yaml << EOF

```

Create the cluster

Notes:
1. Ensure to use the ```--log-level debug``` parameter to see the cluster provisioning activity - useful to detect errors and abort early
2. The ```openshift-install``` command internally uses [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) to perform the actual AWS resource provisioning. Read the [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/aws/index.html#authentication) documentation to determine how to establish AWS credentials so that Terraform can authenticate into your AWS account
3. Ensure that you run the ```openshift-install``` command in the same dir containing the ```install-config.yaml``` file
4. Running the ```openshift-install``` command will result in additional AWS expenditure
5. Make a copy of the ```install-config.yaml``` file if you want to preserve it *BEFORE* you execute the ```openshift-install create cluster``` - as it will be deleted during the cluster creation process
6. Documentation for the configuration of this file can be found https://github.com/openshift/installer/blob/master/docs/user/customization.md

Ok we're ready to launch the cluster...

```
openshift-install create cluster --log-level debug
```

This takes between **20-30 minutes** to complete so sit back and relax, its major chill time :+1:

# STEP5:

Congrats!! 
You've just baked yourself a fresh OpenShift 4 cluster!!

Open the web console and login
* https://console-openshift-console.apps.openshift.democloudinc.com
* https://oauth-openshift.apps.openshift.democloudinc.com/oauth/token/display

Notes:
1. Your URL will be different! This depends on the ```baseDomain``` value used and configured within the ```install-config.yaml```
2. The newly created ```auth``` folder contains credentials for logging into the cluster

# STEP6:

Install the ```oc``` command:

```
curl -O https://mirror.openshift.com/pub/openshift-v4/clients/ocp/4.11.0/openshift-client-mac-4.11.0.tar.gz
tar -xvf openshift-client-mac-4.11.0.tar.gz
cp oc /usr/local/bin/
which oc
```

Note: This script downloads version **4.11.0** of the openshift oc client - a newer version may now exist.

```
oc
oc version
```

Alternatively for MacOS use

```
brew install openshift-cli
```

# STEP7:

Test the client cluster authencation

```
export KUBECONFIG=$(pwd)/auth/kubeconfig
```

```
oc whoami
oc whoami --show-context=true
oc whoami --show-server=true
```

# STEP8:

Install and setup an IDP htpasswd file and import 

Create a new ```users.htpasswd``` file

```
htpasswd -c -B -b users.htpasswd devuser1 blah
cat users.htpasswd
```

Import ```users.htpasswd``` via the web console

Update the permissions on the new user - give cluster admin permissions

```
oc adm policy add-cluster-role-to-user cluster-admin devuser1
oc login -u devuser1 -p blah
oc whoami
oc get user
oc get scc
```

Delete the temp ```kubeadmin``` user

```
oc delete secrets kubeadmin -n kube-system
```

After you define an identity provider and create a new cluster-admin user, you can remove the kubeadmin to improve cluster security.
You must have configured at least one identity provider.
You must have added the cluster-admin role to a user.
You must be logged in as an administrator.

# STEP9:

Create the ```cloudacademy``` project (namespace)

```
oc new-project cloudacademy
oc status
```

or

```
cat <<EOF | oc create -f -
kind: Project
apiVersion: project.openshift.io/v1
metadata:
  name: cloudacademy
  annotations:
    openshift.io/description: ''
    openshift.io/display-name: CloudAcademy
EOF
```

# STEP10:

![OpenShiftDeployment - StatefulSet](/docs/OpenShiftDeployment-StatefulSet.png)

Create a new StorageClass named ```ebs```

```
cat <<EOF | oc create -f -
kind: StorageClass
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: ebs
provisioner: kubernetes.io/aws-ebs
parameters:
  fsType: ext4
  type: gp2
reclaimPolicy: Retain
volumeBindingMode: Immediate
EOF
```

Examine each StorageClass

```
oc get storageclass
```

# STEP11:

Create a new Mongo StatefulSet name ```mongo```

```
cat <<EOF | oc create -f -
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: StatefulSet

EOF
```

Examine the Mongo Pods launch in an ordered sequence

```
oc get pods --watch
oc get pods
oc get pods --show-labels
oc get pods -l role=db
```

Note: **Ctrl-C** to exit the watch

Examine the Persistent Volumes and Persistent Volume Claims

```
oc get pod,pv,pvc
```

# STEP12:

Create a new Headless Service for Mongo named ```mongo```

```
cat <<EOF | oc create -f -
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: mongo
  namespace: cloudacademy
  labels:
    role: db
    env: demo

  - port: 27017
    targetPort: 27017
  clusterIP: None
  selector:
    role: db
EOF
```

Examine the Mongo Headless Service

```
oc get svc
```

Examine the DNS records for the Mongo Headless Service

```
oc run --generator=run-pod/v1 --rm utils -it --image eddiehale/utils bash
```

Within the new utils container run the following DNS queries

```
host mongo
for i in {0..2}; do host mongo-$i.mongo; done
exit
```

# STEP13:

Initialise the Mongo database replica set

```
cat > db.init.js << EOF
rs.initiate();
rs.add("mongo-1.mongo:27017");
rs.add("mongo-2.mongo:27017");
cfg = rs.conf();
cfg.members[0].host = "mongo-0.mongo:27017";
rs.reconfig(cfg, {force: true});
sleep(5000);
EOF
```

```
oc rsh mongo-0 mongo < db.init.js
oc rsh mongo-0 mongo --eval "rs.status()"
```

# STEP14:

Load the initial voting app data into the Mongo database

```
cat > db.load.js << EOF
use langdb;
db.languages.insert({"name" : "go", "codedetail" : { "usecase" : "system, web, server-side", "rank" : 16, "compiled" : true, "homepage" : "https://golang.org", "download" : "https://golang.org/dl/", "votes" : 0}});
db.languages.insert({"name" : "java", "codedetail" : { "usecase" : "system, web, server-side", "rank" : 2, "compiled" : true, "homepage" : "https://www.java.com/en/", "download" : "https://www.java.com/en/download/", "votes" : 0}});

db.languages.find().pretty();
EOF
```

```
oc rsh mongo-0 mongo < db.load.js
oc rsh mongo-0 mongo langdb --eval "db.languages.find().pretty()"
```

# STEP15:

![OpenShiftDeployment - API](/docs/OpenShiftDeployment-API.png)

Deploy the API using:

```
cat <<EOF | oc apply -f -
apiVersion: apps/v1

EOF
```

- Examine the status of the API deployment
- Examine the pods to confirm that they are up and running
- Examine the API pod log to see that it has successfully connected to the MongoDB replicaset

```
oc rollout status deployment api
oc get pods
oc get pods -l role=api
oc logs API_POD_NAME_HERE
oc get svc
oc get route
```

# STEP16:

Test the API route url - test the ```/ok```, ```/languages```, and ```/languages/{name}``` endpoints

```
APIHOST=$(oc get route api -o jsonpath='{.spec.host}')
echo $APIHOST
```

```
curl -s $APIHOST/ok
```

Note: The following commands leverage the [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) utility to format the json data responses

```
curl -s $APIHOST/languages | jq .
curl -s $APIHOST/languages/go | jq .
curl -s $APIHOST/languages/java | jq .
curl -s $APIHOST/languages/nodejs | jq .
```

# STEP17:

![OpenShiftDeployment](/docs/OpenShiftDeployment-Build.png)

Install and setup the S2I executable

https://github.com/openshift/source-to-image/releases/

```
https://github.com/openshift/source-to-image/releases/download/v1.3.1/source-to-image-v1.3.1-a5a77147-darwin-amd64.tar.gz
tar -xvf source-to-image-v1.3.1-a5a77147-darwin-amd64.tar.gz
cp s2i /usr/local/bin/
which s2i
```

Alternatively for MacOS use

```
brew install source-to-image
```

# STEP18:

Try out the S2I generator

```
s2i create xyzbuilder s2i-xyzbuilder
```

Examine the new ```s2i-xyzbuilder``` directory structure

```
tree s2i-xyzbuilder
```

Examine the ```Makefile```, ```Dockerfile```, ```assemble```, and ```run``` files

```
cat ./s2i-xyzbuilder/Makefile
cat ./s2i-xyzbuilder/Dockerfile
cat ./s2i-xyzbuilder/s2i/bin/assemble
cat ./s2i-xyzbuilder/s2i/bin/run
```

Create the S2I builder image

Note: You will need to have a docker daemon configured and available before running the ```make``` command. Consider setting the ```DOCKER_HOST``` environment variable

```
(cd ./s2i-xyzbuilder && make)
```

Examine the newly created docker image

```
docker images | grep xyzbuilder
```

# STEP19:

Git clone the example frontend builder S2I repo

```
git clone https://github.com/cloudacademy/openshift-s2i-frontendbuilder.git
```

Examine the new ```openshift-s2i-frontendbuilder``` directory structure

```
cd openshift-s2i-frontendbuilder/
tree
```

Examine the ```Makefile```, ```Dockerfile```, ```assemble```, and ```run``` files

```
cat Makefile
cat Dockerfile
cat s2i/bin/assemble
cat s2i/bin/run
```

Create the builder image

```
make
```

Examine the newly created docker image with tag ```cloudacademydevops/frontendbuilder```

```
docker images | grep cloudacademydevops/frontendbuilder
```

# STEP20:

Build the runtime frontend container image, injecting the GitHub hosted [openshift-voteapp-frontend-react](https://github.com/cloudacademy/openshift-voteapp-frontend-react) source code for the React based web frontend repo into the builder image

```
s2i build https://github.com/cloudacademy/openshift-voteapp-frontend-react cloudacademydevops/frontendbuilder cloudacademydevops/frontend:demo-v1
```

Examine the docker images for the ```cloudacademydevops/frontend:demo-v1``` image

```
docker images | grep cloudacademydevops/frontend | grep demo-v1
```

Test locally the runtime ```cloudacademydevops/frontend:demo-v1``` docker image

```
docker run -e REACT_APP_APIHOSTPORT=xxxxxxxxxxxx -it --rm --name test -p 8080:8080 cloudacademydevops/frontend:demo-v1
```

Browse to the application and ensure that the ```REACT_APP_APIHOSTPORT``` environment variable has been correctly injected and is being used for the AJAX calls to the API

# STEP21:

Upload the S2I Frontend builder image into a DockerHub repo managed by yourself. In the instructions that follow, the [cloudacademydevops](https://hub.docker.com/r/cloudacademydevops/frontendbuilder/tags) DockerHub repo is used.

Note:
1. You must use your own DockerHub repo - you will not have permissions to push into the [cloudacademydevops](https://hub.docker.com/r/cloudacademydevops/frontendbuilder/tags) repo.

```
docker login
docker push cloudacademydevops/frontendbuilder:latest
```

Now import it from DockerHub into the OpenShift cluster

```
oc import-image docker.io/cloudacademydevops/frontendbuilder:latest --confirm -n cloudacademy
```

Examine the current ImageStreams

```
oc get imagestreams
oc describe is frontendbuilder
```

# STEP22:

Create a new BuildConfig for the frontend

Note:
1. Consider forking the GitHub repo: https://github.com/cloudacademy/openshift-voteapp-frontend-react
2. Then update the ```source/git/uri``` field in the following BuildConfig resource with your forked GitHub URL
3. Update the secret value - use your own secret

```
cat <<EOF | oc apply -f -
kind: BuildConfig
apiVersion: build.openshift.io/v1
metadata:
  name: frontend
  namespace: cloudacademy
spec:
  output:
    to:
      kind: ImageStreamTag
      name: 'frontend:latest'
  resources: {}
  successfulBuildsHistoryLimit: 5
  failedBuildsHistoryLimit: 5
  strategy:
    type: Source
    sourceStrategy:
      from:
        kind: ImageStreamTag
        namespace: cloudacademy
        name: 'frontendbuilder:latest'
  postCommit: {}
  source:
    type: Git
    git:
      uri: 'https://github.com/cloudacademy/openshift-voteapp-frontend-react'
      ref: master
  triggers:
    - type: GitHub
      github:
        secret: supersecretgoeshere
  runPolicy: Serial
EOF
```

Examine current BuildConfigs

```
oc get buildconfig
oc describe buildconfig frontend
```

# STEP23:

Create a new ImageStream named frontend - this will be populated with frontend images created by the frontend buildconfig

```
oc create imagestream frontend
```

Examine all current image storageClassName

```
oc get is
```

# STEP24:

Trigger a manual build for the frontend and tail the resulting build log

```
oc start-build frontend --follow
```

or 

```
oc get builds
oc logs -f build/BUILD_NAME --tail=50
```

# STEP25:

![OpenShiftDeployment](/docs/OpenShiftDeployment-Frontend.png)

Create a new frontend DeploymentConfig

Notes: 
1. Before deploying the actual DeploymentConfig, we make a call to ```oc get route api``` to determine the HOST/PORT location for the API external service to which AJAX calls initiated from the browser will be directed at. 
2. The value is captured in the ```APIHOST``` variable and then this is injected into the DeploymentConfig ```REACT_APP_APIHOSTPORT``` environment var just before it is created within the cluster

```
oc get route api
```

```
APIHOST=$(oc get route api -o jsonpath='{.spec.host}')
echo $APIHOST
```

```

Examine the rollout of the DeploymentConfig

```
oc rollout status deploymentconfig frontend
oc get pods
oc get pods -l role=frontend
```

Use the ```curl``` command to test the application via the frontend route url

```
oc get route frontend
```

```
FRONTENDHOST=$(oc get route frontend -o jsonpath='{.spec.host}')
echo $FRONTENDHOST
```

```
curl -s -I $FRONTENDHOST
curl -s -i $FRONTENDHOST
```

Now test the full end-to-end application using the Chrome browser...

Note: Use the Developer Tools within the Chrome browser to record, filter, and observe the AJAX traffic (XHR) which is generated when any of the +1 vote buttons are clicked.

# STEP26:

Tail the Frontend and/or API pod logs

Note: Incoming traffic to the pods are load balanced using a round-robin strategy

```
oc logs dc/frontend --tail 50 --follow
oc logs deploy/api --tail 50 --follow
```

Check the updated vote count held within the Mongo database

```
oc get pods -l role=db
oc rsh mongo-0 mongo langdb --eval "db.languages.find().pretty()"
```

# STEP27:

Configure auto build and deployments for the Frontend pods

```
oc get bc
oc describe bc frontend
```

Copy the Github webhook url, this can also be found and copied from within the Openshift web admin console

Note: the Github webhook url has the secret blanked out - you will need to manually edit it back into the url - it needs to be the same value as used within the BuildConfig created in step 22. Alternatively you can copy it from the OpenShift web admin console within the Builds/Build Configs/frontend section

The full Github URL should look something similar to the following:

```
https://api.openshift.democloudinc.com:6443/apis/build.openshift.io/v1/namespaces/cloudacademy/buildconfigs/frontend/webhooks/supersecretgoeshere/github
```

Within your equivalent [openshift-voteapp-frontend-react](https://github.com/cloudacademy/openshift-voteapp-frontend-react) Github repo - that you forked earlier (step 22.1), perform the following steps to configure a Webhook that will trigger an automated OpenShift build whenever a push is performed to it:

GitHub Webhook Setup Instructions:
1. Under Settings->Webhooks, click the "Add Webhook" button
2. Enter the buildconfig URL into the Payload URL
3. Set Content-Type to be "application/json"
4. Leave the Secret field empty
5. Disable SSL verification - during testing and demos
6. Then click the "Add webhook" button at the bottom 

Confirm that the Webhook configuration has been successfully set

# STEP28:

Now perform an edit within the VoteApp codebase.

For example update the [VoteApp.js](https://github.com/cloudacademy/openshift-voteapp-frontend-react/blob/master/src/components/VoteApp.js) file, remembering to do so within in your own equivalent forked repo - increment the version number in the ```CloudAcademy ❤ DevOps 2019 v2.10.1``` string:

```
openshift-voteapp-frontend-react/src/components/VoteApp.js

import React, { Component } from 'react';
import ProgrammingLanguage from './ProgrammingLanguage';

class VoteApp extends Component {
  render () {
    return (
      <main role="main">
        <div class="jumbotron">
          <div class="container">
            <h1 class="display-3">Language Vote App v2</h1>
            &copy; CloudAcademy ❤ DevOps 2019 v2.10.1
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="container">
          <div class="row">
            <div class="col-md-4">
              <ProgrammingLanguage id="go" logo="go.png"/>
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-4">
              <ProgrammingLanguage id="java" logo="java.png"/>
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-4">
              <ProgrammingLanguage id="nodejs" logo="nodejs.png"/>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
      </main>
    )
  }
}

export default VoteApp;
```

Save, commit, and push back into the repo

```
git add VoteApp.js
git commit -m "updated to trigger a build"
git push
```

# STEP29:

Check that a new OpenShift build has been triggered

```
oc get builds
```

Tail the new build

```
oc logs -f build/BUILD_NAME
```

When the build completes examine the latest image frontend container

```
oc describe is frontend
```

With the successful completion of the latest build for the frontend container image a new automatic DeploymentConfig update will be triggered and rolled out into the cluster. We can watch the status of the rollout

```
oc rollout status deploymentconfig frontend
oc get pods
oc get pods -l role=frontend
```

Confirm the complete end-to-end build and deploy process has worked byvrefreshing the application within the browser and observing the latest edits just made!!

Result!!

:metal: 

# STEP30

When you've finished with the OpenShift cluster and no longer need it:

Consider tearing it down:

```
openshift-install destroy cluster
```

Log back into the [cloud.redhat.com](https://cloud.redhat.com/openshift/install) portal and delete the respective cluster subscription
